# Email-Spam-Classification-using-Random-Forest
Project Title: Email Spam Classification using Random Forest
This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model for the automatic classification of emails into spam and non-spam (ham) categories using the Random Forest algorithm. The primary objective is to create an efficient and accurate system to filter out unwanted email spam, improving user productivity and email inbox management.

Key Features:

Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm, known for its effectiveness in classification tasks, to classify incoming emails.
Leverages a labeled dataset of spam and ham emails for training and evaluation.
Employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and extract relevant features from email content.
Implements feature engineering to enhance classification accuracy.
Provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the spam filter.
Offers real-time email classification, making it suitable for email clients or server-side filtering.
Includes robust evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance, such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
How to Use:

Clone or download the repository to access the code and pre-trained model.
Follow the provided documentation to set up the environment and deploy the spam filter.
Integrate the model into your email client or server for real-time classification.
Customize and fine-tune the model with your email data, if required.
Contribute to the project by providing feedback, enhancements, or additional features.
Dependencies:

Python 3.x
Scikit-learn (for Random Forest implementation)
Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (e.g., NLTK or spaCy)
Email parsing and handling libraries (e.g., email library)
